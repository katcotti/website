Welcome to my website & environmental data science blog! My name is Kat, and I am currently a first-year Master Student in Environmental Science & Management at the Bren School. I grew up in the small Southern California town of Ojai, about an hour from Santa Barbara, and spent most of my childhood hiking or at the barn riding horses.

I graduated from the University of California, Davis, in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science and Managerial Economics. From a young age I intended to pursue a career as an equine veterinarian; however, my time at Davis gave me invaluable exposure to the animal agriculture industry which inspired my career shift to focus on the intersection between environmental science & animal agriculture. I am specifically interested in working in the corporate sector to develop solutions for mitigating anthropogenic emissions from animal agriculture. While in undergrad, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a study abroad field study program in Banff National Park, studying the wildlife corridors and their conservation impact, which furthered my passion for environmental science.

Post undergrad, I spent the summer working on an organic farm on the Big Island of Hawaii then worked as a veterinary technician for a small animal hospital in Santa Barbara before starting at Bren. In my free time, I still enjoy spending time at the barn, and continue to teach children riding lessons and train young horses while in graduate school. I also love to travel and enjoy surfing, hiking, backpacking, and taking the advantage of the outdoors! I'm excited to have found my way back to the Santa Barbara area and to further my education at the Bren School.
