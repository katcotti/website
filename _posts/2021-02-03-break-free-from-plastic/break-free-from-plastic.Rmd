I had a lot of fun learning how to analyze spatial data & making a cloropleth map with the 'rnaturalearth' package to participate in Tidy Tuesday 1.26.2021. I made a world map showing the total plastic counts for 2020 and played around with the 'viridis' package to update the color gradient of my map!
