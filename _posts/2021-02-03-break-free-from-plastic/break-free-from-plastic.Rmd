### Summary: 
This post explores how to analyze spatial data & build a choropleth map with the `rnaturalearth` package to participate in Tidy Tuesday 1.26.2021. This post shows how to load in tidyTuesday data, merge spatial data frames using `left_join`, and build a finalized  map. I wanted to look at total plastic counts by country and display this on a spatial choropleth map. This is my first attempt at spacial data visualization and it was exciting to give spatial mapping a try for tidyTuesday!

At first, I had issues reading in a spatial data frame for the world map outline, but the rnaturalearth package has built in world maps. I made a world map showing the total plastic counts for 2020 and played around with the `viridis` package to update the color gradient of the map, and I learned how to change background color of a plot using `plot.background` in `theme()`.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = FALSE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
library(maps)
library(rnaturalearth)
```

### Reading in tidyTuesday data:  

```{r}
# Read in the data:
plastics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')
```

### Data Wrangling: 
For this map I wanted to look at total plastic counts for 2020, so I filtered the data using various functions from the `dplyr` package:

```{r}
# Data Wrangling - Sum of total plastic counts by country:
plastics_summary <- plastics %>% 
# Remove NA values:
  drop_na(grand_total) %>% 
# Filter to only keep counts from 2020:
  filter(year == 2020) %>% 
# Group by country:
  group_by(country) %>% 
# Find total plastics per country: 
  summarize(total_plastics = sum(grand_total)) 
```

### Making a chloropleth map using the 'rnaturalearth' package: 
```{r}
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") 

world_p <- plastics_summary %>% 
  left_join(world, ., by = c("name" = "country"))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world_p,
          aes(fill = total_plastics), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "viridis",
                     begin = 0.25,
                     end = 1,
                     breaks = c(10000, 20000,30000,40000,50000,60000),
                     name = "Total Plastics")   +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA)) +
  labs(title = "Worldwide Total Plastic Counts in 2020") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
