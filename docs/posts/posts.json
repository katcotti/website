I grew up in the small town of Ojai California and recently returned to the Santa Barbara area after completing my bachelor’s degree from UC Davis in 2019. I’m a huge animal lover! I have been riding horses since I was three years old and continue to teach riding lessons and train young horses while in grad school. I love to backpack and travel, and outside of the classroom you will likely find me surfing, hiking, or doing yoga!\n\n\n\n\n",
